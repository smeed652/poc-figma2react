# üõ†Ô∏è Buildout Checklist

**POC Goal:** Take a UI element from Figma all the way to a production-quality React component, leveraging Storybook for isolated development, documentation, and control. The end result is a single component on a page, fully manipulable and built using this workflow.

This checklist guides the Figma-to-React POC process.

1. [ ] **Analyze Figma Design**
    1.1. [ ] List all atomic components (atoms, molecules, organisms)
    1.2. [ ] Document design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing)
    1.3. [ ] Export assets if needed
    1.4. [ ] Verification: Confirm all UI elements are accounted for

2. [ ] **Project Setup**
    2.1. [ ] Clone starter stack into new directory
    2.2. [ ] Install dependencies
    2.3. [ ] Run dev server and Storybook
    2.4. [ ] Verification: Confirm environment runs and is ready

3. [ ] **Component Buildout**
    3.1. [ ] Build atomic components (atoms)
    3.2. [ ] Build molecules and organisms
    3.3. [ ] Add Storybook stories for each
    3.4. [ ] Verification: Visual check in Storybook

4. [ ] **Page Assembly**
    4.1. [ ] Assemble templates and pages
    4.2. [ ] Add sample data/mocks if needed
    4.3. [ ] Verification: Pages match Figma design

5. [ ] **Testing & Review**
    5.1. [ ] Write simple tests for key components
    5.2. [ ] Review for accessibility and responsiveness
    5.3. [ ] Verification: All tests pass and design matches expectations
