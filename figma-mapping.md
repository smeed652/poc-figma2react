# Figma-to-React Mapping Template

Use this table to track Figma layer names and their mapped React/atomic component names. Update this as you rename layers in Figma or as your component structure evolves.

## Instructions
- For each Figma layer, write the new name youâ€™ll use in your React codebase.
- Mark any changes you need to make in Figma (e.g., renaming, grouping, clarification).
- Update this file as you go to keep design and code in sync.
